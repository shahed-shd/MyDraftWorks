Notes:
    - Assertions are disabled by default, so one must run the program with the -ea argument in order for assertions to be enabled (java -ea [name of compiled program])
    - Parameter passing to method:
        - The primitive types are passed in by value. There is no more link between the value inside the method and the source variable.
        - An object reference is the link between a variable name and an instance of object.
        - The object references are passed by value:
            - There is no more link between the reference inside the method and the source reference
            - The source object itself and the object itself inside the method are still the same.

Notes:
    - Assertions are disabled by default, so one must run the program with the -ea argument in order for assertions to be enabled (java -ea [name of compiled program])
    - If no constructor is defined in a class, the compiler will create a default so called 'empty constructor' automatically.
    - Parameter passing to method:
        - The primitive types are passed in by value. There is no more link between the value inside the method and the source variable.
        - An object reference is the link between a variable name and an instance of object.
        - The object references are passed by value:
            - There is no more link between the reference inside the method and the source reference
            - The source object itself and the object itself inside the method are still the same.
    - StringBuilder is faster but not thread-safe, StringBuffer is slower than StringBuilder but thread-safe.
    - We can assign the created object reference to:
        - the class
        - super class
        - an interface the class implements    
    - Casts can occur in three ways:
        - Up-casting going up in the inheritance tree, until we reach the Object
        - Up-casting to an interface the class implements
        - Down-casting until we reach the class the object was created from

- docker image run:
  - docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -d -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts
- Jenkins project types:
  - freestyle:
    - simple, single tasks
    - e.g. run tests
  - pipeline:
    - whole delivery cycle
    - e.g. test | build | ...
    - for a single branch
  - multibranch pipeline:
    - like pipeline, for multiple branches
    - of the same repository
- credential scopes:
  - system: Only available for Jenkins server, not for Jenkins jobs
  - global: Everywhere accessible
  - project: Limited to project, only with multibranch pipeline
- pipeline syntax:
  - scripted:
    - groovy engine
    - advanced scripting capability, high flexibility
  - declarative:
    - recent addition
    - easier to get started but not that powerful
    - predefined structure:
      - pipeline:
        - must be top level
      - agent:
          - where to execute
          - like a node or executor on that node
      - environment:
        - for custom environment variables
      - stages:
          - contain multiple stages
          - stage (build, test, deploy etc):
            - when:
              - expression:
                - Boolean expression for condtion
            - steps:
              - can run `echo` to print a message/log
              - script:
                - to run script with groovy expressions
      - post:
        - Execute some logic after all stages executed
        - always
        - success
        - failure
  - Environment variables in Jenkinsfile:
    - Built-in ones can be found in URL path 'env-vars.html' of jenkins server
    - Custome ones in 'environment' block of Jenkinsfile
- 2 ways to trigger build:
  - push notification:
    - Version Control notifies Jenkins on new commit
    - install Jenkins plugin depending on VCS
    - configure repository server hostname, access token or credential
  - pulling:
    - Jenkins pulls in regular intervals

Notes:
    - To change inner-html, document.getElementById('idname').innerHTML = 'content'
    - To change HTML attribute, document.getElementById('idname').attribute_name = 'attribute_value'
    - To change HTML style, document.getElementById('idname').style.attribute_name = 'attribute_value'
    - JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML. Thus the type attribute is not required as <script type="text/javascript"> </script>.
    - Any number of scripts can be placed in an HTML document.
    - Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
    - Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, because script compilation slows down the display.
    - Using an external script, <script src="scriptFileName.js"></script>
    - Output ways:
        - Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML
        - Writing into the HTML output using document.write()
        - Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
        - Writing into the browser console, using console.log()
    - In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.
    - Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.
    - Single line comments using //, multiline comments using /* */
    - Identifiers are case sensitive.
    - A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.
    - Putting a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated. That is, x = "5" + 2 + 3; will assign "523" to x. But x = 2 + 4 + "5" + 7; will assign "657" to x.
    - Re-declaring a JavaScript variable will not lose its value.
    - JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.
    - The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression.
    - The instanceof operator returns true if an object is an instance of an object type.
    - Undefined and null are equal in value but different in type.
    - Object properties are accessed in two ways, objectName.propertyName or objectName["propertyName"]
    - Data types:
        - 5 different data types that can contain values:
            - string
            - number
            - boolean
            - object
            - function
        - 3 types of objects:
            - Object
            - Date
            - Array
        - 2 data types that can't contain values:
            - null
            - undefined
    - Number() converts to a Number, String() converts to a String, Boolean() converts to a Boolean.
    - The 'constructor' property returns the constructor function for all JavaScript variables.

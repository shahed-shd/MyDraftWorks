Notes:
    - To change innter-html, document.getElementById('idname').innerHTML = 'content'
    - To change HTML attribute, document.getElementById('idname').attribute_name = 'attribute_value'
    - To change HTML style, document.getElementById('idname').style.attribute_name = 'attribute_value'
    - JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML. Thus the type attribute is not required as <script type="text/javascript"> </script>.
    - Any number of scripts can be placed in an HTML document.
    - Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
    - Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, because script compilation slows down the display.
    - Using an external script, <script src="scriptFileName.js"></script>
    - Output ways:
        - Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML
        - Writing into the HTML output using document.write()
        - Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
        - Writing into the browser console, using console.log()
    -  Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.
    - Single line comments using //, multiline comments using /* */
    - Identifiers are case sensitive.
    - A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.
    - Putting a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated. That is, x = "5" + 2 + 3; will assign "523" to x. But x = 2 + 4 + "5" + 7; will assign "657" to x.
    - The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression.
    - Undefined and null are equal in value but different in type.
    - Object properties in two ways, objectName.propertyName or objectName["propertyName"]

Notes:
    - Assertions are disabled by default, so one must run the program with the -ea argument in order for assertions to be enabled (java -ea [name of compiled program])
    - Primitive types:
        - boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, double
        - Can't be inherited.
        - Can't be instantiated.
        - Only its value is stored in memory.
        - The allocated space is fixed.
        - Don't have methods callable on them.
    - Array element type encoding:
        - boolean: Z
        - byte: B
        - char: C
        - class or interface: Lclassname;
        - double: D
        - float: F
        - int: I
        - long: J
        - short: S
    - Class and object:
        - Along with object's (class's instance) value, also a reference to the instance can be stored in memory.
        - The allocated space can vary, for instance either the object is instantiated or not.
        - In Java, a class can only inherit from one class whereas it can implement several interfaces.
        - If no constructor is defined in a class, the compiler will create a default so called 'empty constructor' automatically.
        - A constructor can't be abstract, final, native, static, strictfp nor synchronized.
        - If there is no explicit call to super(...), then the default superclass constructor super(); is called before the body of the constructor is executed.
        - After constructor overloading, a constructor can be called within the body of other constructor of the same class using 'this' keyword. This call must be the first statement in constructor.
        - Object cloning using clone() method is much faster than creating objects using the 'new' keyword and copying each variable.
        - If a class declares two public methods with the same name by method overloading, and a subclass overrides one of them, the subclass still inherits the other method. In this respect, the Java differs from C++.
        - In method overriding, the visibility of the new method that overrides the super class method can not be reduced but can be increased.
        - An overridden method must throw the same exceptions as the super class, or their subexceptions.
        - When a type that is defined with generic (for example, Collection<T>) is not used with generics (for example, Collection) is called a 'raw type'.
        - For generic type defined for just a method, the actual type will be defined by the type of the method parameter. Hence, the generic type can't be defined only for the return value as it wouldn't be resolved.
        - The generic type information is erased during compilation. Generic type parameters are replaced with their bounds or Object if the type parameters are unbounded. The produced bytecode, therefore, contains only ordinary classes, interfaces, and methods. The compiler inserts type casts if necessary to preserve type safety. The compiler generates bridge methods to preserve polymorphism in extended generic types.
    - Interface:
        - A field is always a constant. That is, it is always public, static and final, even if you do not mention it.
        - A method must be public and abstract, but it is not required to write the public and abstract keywords.
        - Constructors are forbidden.
    - Parameter passing to method:
        - The primitive types are passed in by value. There is no more link between the value inside the method and the source variable.
        - An object reference is the link between a variable name and an instance of object.
        - The object references are passed by value:
            - There is no more link between the reference inside the method and the source reference
            - The source object itself and the object itself inside the method are still the same.
    - String:
        - Strings are immutable. Whenever it looks as if a String object was modified, actually a new String object was created.
        - Strings are stored in a place in memory called the String Constant Pool. If the 'new' keyword is not explicitly used when creating the String it checks to see if it already exists in the Pool and uses the existing one. If it does not exist, a new Object is created.
        - StringBuilder is faster but not thread-safe, StringBuffer is slower than StringBuilder but thread-safe.
    - We can assign the created object reference to:
        - the class
        - super class
        - an interface the class implements    
    - Casts can occur in three ways:
        - Up-casting going up in the inheritance tree, until we reach the Object
        - Up-casting to an interface the class implements
        - Down-casting until we reach the class the object was created from
    - The equals method implements an equivalence relation:
        - It is reflexive: for any reference value x, x.equals(x) should return true.
        - It is symmetric: for any reference values x and y, x.equals(y) should return true if and only if y.equals(x) returns true.
        - It is transitive: for any reference values x, y, and z, if x.equals(y) returns true and y.equals(z) returns true, then x.equals(z) should return true.
        - It is consistent: for any reference values x and y, multiple invocations of x.equals(y) consistently return true or consistently return false, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified.
        - For any non-null reference value x, x.equals(null) should return false.
    - Packages:
        - If no package is declared for a class, its package is the default package.
        - The java.lang package is implicitly imported in all classes.
        - A package name should start with a lower character.

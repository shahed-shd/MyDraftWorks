Notes:
    - all keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are NOT case-sensitive.
    - Variable names are case-sensitive.
    - Three variable scopes:
        - local
        - global
        - static.
    - A variable declared outside a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function.
    - A variable declared within a function has a LOCAL SCOPE and can only be accessed within that function.
    - Global variables can be accessed in a function using 'global' keyword.
    - All global variables are stored in an array called $GLOBALS[index], The index holds the name of the variable.
    - Static variables are declared using keyword 'static' and won't be deleted after execution of the function and still local to the function.
    - Two basic ways to get output, echo and print.
    - echo vs print:
        - echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1. So it can be used in expressions.
        - echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument.
        - echo is marginally faster than print.
    - Data types:
        - String
        - Integer
        - Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
        - Boolean
        - Array
        - Object
        - NULL
        - Resource
    - var_dump() is used to dump info about a variable.
    - Short tag format <?=   ?>
    - In formatted print, if there's more % than arguments, a place holder is needed. Place holder format is %n\$ where n is the argument number. Example as printf("I have %1\$d books, %2\$d pens and %2\$d pencils.", $b, $p);
    - Function names are NOT case-sensitive.
    - Superglobal variables:
        - $GLOBALS
        - $_SERVER
        - $_REQUEST
        - $_POST
        - $_GET
        - $_FILES
        - $_ENV
        - $_COOKIE
        - $_SESSION

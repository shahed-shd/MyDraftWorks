Notes:
  - all keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are NOT case-sensitive.
  - Variable names are case-sensitive.
  - Three variable scopes:
    - local
    - global
    - static.
  - A variable declared outside a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function.
  - A variable declared within a function has a LOCAL SCOPE and can only be accessed within that function.
  - Global variables can be accessed in a function using 'global' keyword.
  - All global variables are stored in an array called $GLOBALS[index], The index holds the name of the variable.
  - Static variables are declared using keyword 'static' and won't be deleted after execution of the function and still local to the function.
  - Two basic ways to get output, echo and print.
  - echo vs print:
    - echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1. So it can be used in expressions.
    - echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument.
    - echo is marginally faster than print.
  - Data types:
    - String
    - Integer
    - Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
    - Boolean
    - Array
    - Object
    - NULL
    - Resource
  - var_dump() is used to dump info about a variable.
